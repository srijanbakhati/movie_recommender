Movie Recommendation System
This repository contains a project that demonstrates how to build a movie recommendation system using machine learning and data processing techniques. It recommends movies based on the type of movie you provide. The project utilizes the TMDb 5000 Movies dataset to recommend movies based on user preferences.

Features
•	Text Preprocessing: Includes techniques such as stopword removal to clean the dataset.
•	Data Analysis: Exploratory data analysis to understand the movie dataset.
•	Recommendation Algorithm: Uses similarity metrics to recommend movies based on user input.

Dataset
The project uses the TMDb 5000 Movies dataset, which contains information such as:
•	Genres
•	Budget
•	Keywords
•	original language
•	Overviews and tags
•	Popularity
•	production companies
•	tagline

Requirements
The following Python libraries are required to run the project:
•	pandas
•	numpy
•	scikit-learn
•	nltk (for natural language processing)

Install dependencies using:
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn nltk

Getting Started
1.	Clone the repository:
Bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movie-recommendation-system.git

cd movie-recommendation-system
3.	Download the dataset:
o	Place the tmdb_5000_movies.csv file in the root directory.
4.	Run the Python script:
Bash
python Movie_recommendation.py
5.	Input a movie title to receive recommendations.
Project Structure
•	Movie_recommendation.py: The main Python script implementing the recommendation system.
•	tmdb_5000_movies.csv: Dataset containing movie details.
•	README.md: Project documentation.

Methodology
1.	Data Cleaning:
o	Removed stopwords and unnecessary columns to prepare the data for analysis.
2.	Feature Engineering:
o	Processed textual data to extract meaningful features.
o	Calculated similarity scores to recommend movies.
3.	Recommendation System:
o	Uses content-based filtering to recommend movies similar to the user’s input.


Example Usage
Bash
Input: Inception
Output: Interstellar, The Dark Knight, Memento, ...
